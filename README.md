Starting my journey to learn this horrible language with the help of (https://lowlevel.academy/)[lowlevelacademy] please let me just use rust.</br>

## TODOS
- [X] add -r flag to remove employees based on name ( maybe remove one unless like -rr flag ? idk ) 
kinda done i am sure it sucks, i just have to clear the file from the other data
- [ ] add -u flag to update employee hours based on name
This is me going off scope but who cares really
- [ ] Use zig to build the project, i hate make already, what magic is this.
